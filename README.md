# 🛣️ Road Crossing Game

Road Crossing Game is a step-by-step project I’m building as part of the Phaser Mini-Degree course on Zenva, to learn the basics of 2D game development with JavaScript and Phaser 3.
This project covers loading assets, setting up the game scene, adding the player and obstacles, managing collisions, and implementing core game logic.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository follows the main milestones of the Zenva Phaser Mini-Degree course.
Each commit is one step further in learning Phaser, starting from a basic empty scene up to a functional crossing game.
